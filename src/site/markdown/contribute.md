# Contribute

Tawja Maven Skin is an open-source project and all contributions are welcome to assist with its
development and maintenance. The skin originated as a new skin for the upcoming
[Tawja Platform (Open-Source)][tawja] release, which uses Maven site for its documentation.

As it is quite hard to find a modern maven skin that use a recent Bootstrap version 
that can be customized to fit main organization site design, we decided to fork an existing project and update it.

As all Tawja projects work, Tawja Maven skin and the associated Tawja tools (Velocity, ...) can be
used freely and are released under [Apache License 2.0][apache-license].
